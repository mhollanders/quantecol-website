description: Accounting for DMSO in biofilm studies.
---

Kate Summer *et al.* recently published an open access manuscript in [*Biofilm*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioflm.2022.100081), for which **Quantecol** conducted the statistical analysis. 

The authors make a strong case for controlling for the effects of the solvent dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) in biofilm studies. In addition to a literature review of 76 published studies, Summer conducted experiments on the bacteria *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* to determine to what extent DMSO affected biofilm formation. We analysed the microbial activity and biofilm inhibition in these experiments using hormetic dose-response models.
