We provide custom services tailored to the requirements of the client. This ranges from as simple as a brief consultation about methodology or analysis, to a report containing full data analysis, code, and results. What we offer is:

  - Methodological guidance
  - Consultations about study design
  - Validation of statistical analysis
  - Tutorials and workshops for specific statistical methods
  - Collaboration on research projects
  - Data and output visualisation

  - (Generalised) linear models
  - Power analysis
  - Multivariate analysis
  - Dose-response models
  - Ordinal regression
  - Item-response models
  - Ecological models
    - Mark-recapture
    - Multievent
    - (Dynamic) occupancy, including co-occurrence
    - (Dynamic) *N*/multinomial-mixture
    - Spatial mark-recapture
